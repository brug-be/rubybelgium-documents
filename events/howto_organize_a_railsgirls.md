# How to organize Rails Girls Brussels

_Revision 2.0 written by Oana Sipos @ 1st of October 2016_

## 1. Location

We have always organized the workshop in Beta Cowork, which has always been kind to us with offering us space & support during the event day.

## 2. Date

We suggest to create a doodle and propose 2-3 options for a potential date where interested coaches can vote upon. Make sure to check for other events in the field to avoid overlapping and coaches having to cancel (FOSDEM, Ruby Camp, Coder Dojos (some coaches are involved there too!), etc).

Once the date is chosen, announce it:
- on the coaches mailing list
- confirm with location
- start buzzing on Facebook & Twitter about it
- remember to mention [Ruby Belgium](http://rubybelgium.be/) which is behind it

## 3. Coaches

- database of coaches - in Drive + see Slack channel
- try to get girls as coaches too, girls like it and feel more comfortable

## 4. Sponsorship

- database of companies we always write to - in Drive
- feel free to enrich it & contact other people / organizations

## 5. Budget

- low: food (breakfast + lunch) + drinks + snacks + beer + coffee + tea + stickers
- max: low + t-shirts + dinner / drinks for coaches (as a "thank you")

## 6. Participants

- send out call for applications: approx. 1 month before
- 2 weeks to apply
- one week to send results + get confirmations
- if you want 25 participants, accept 4-5 extra people (some will anyway drop or cancel last minute or simply not show up)
- send e-mails to ex-participants mentioning we are doing it again and to ask to spread the word
- as for "how to select participants": up to organizers and coaches. My selection criteria was to give priority to those who showed real interest. One liners answers did not impress me, just as super-long stories don't give more chances. Balance is key and especially an emphasise on **how will this workshop help you in your day to day life, in your work, in the impact you will have as a person on the society**.
- we had guys at the workshop, but eventually decided not to accept anymore and focus only on girls
- it would be great if by Saturday morning there can be a list of groups (what participants will each coach take care of)
- it would be even greater if participants' level will be approximately the same to make it smoother with explanations and speed

## 7. Social Media / Promotion

- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RailsGirlsBrussels/
- Twitter: https://twitter.com/railsgirls_be
- Rails Girls site (GitHub account): http://railsgirls.com/brussels â€” this is a private repo so you need to have access. For now, [Oana Sipos](https://twitter.com/oanasipos) has access from the team.

## 8. Schedule

#### Friday evening
- we try to get sticks with all the stuff we want to install (Ruby, Rails, Sublime)
- for Rails, we follow guidelines from [Rails Girls website](http://guides.railsgirls.com/install)
- good luck with Windows or very old OSx versions - suggest instead an environment with a cloud IDE: e.g. https://www.nitrous.io/

#### Saturday

Big block so far:

- 9-10 = Breakfast
- 10 - 10:15 = Welcome & intro
- 10:15 - 13 = First working block
- 13 - 14 = Lunch
- 14 - 16:30 = Second working block
- 16:30 - 16:50 = Lightning talks
- 16:50 - 17 = Closing
- 17 + = Drinking & cleaning time

Regarding intro:
- make sure to have an agenda for the day and explain what will happen so participants know what to expect
- make sure to thank everybody who is making IT happen: coaches, companies who sponsor, location, bloggers/organizations who promote us etc.
- get the participants in the mood of being there and **feeling comfortable to ask questions** [emphasise this 20 times if needed :P]

Regarding the 2 working blocks, you can either follow:
- the official Rails Girls guide: http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/
- the Rails Girls Brussels guide: http://railsgirls-be.github.io/railsgirls_guide/
  - this has been developed after discussions with coaches who have considered starting with Rails directly is a bad idea

General remark about schedule:
- keep time
- be on time (deliver what you promise)
- if you cannot deliver, put a buffer time
