# Ruby Burger

[Ruby Burger](http://rubyburgers.co/) is an informal meetup gathering Rubyist, usually once a month.
It started as a joke to help people discover great burger joints in Brussels, and the first was so a success that we
decided to continue it.

There is no better way to know each other than sharing food, drinks, and discussions. That's what a ruby burger is.
