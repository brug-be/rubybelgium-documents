## Code of Conduct

Christophe suggets to adopt a [code of conduct](https://github.com/brug-be/code_of_conduct) for the events we are running. It is based on the one we got for Arrrrcamp.

## RubyCamp Winter 2016

Thomas and Tomasz are organizing a RubyCamp Winter 2016.

## Rails Girls (next session, new organizer)

Oana has found a new organizer, and a new edition will be organized soon.

## BRUG (new Brussel organizer, new Chapter)

* Christophe [wrote down what to do to organize a BRUG](https://github.com/brug-be/rubybelgium-documents/blob/master/events/howto_organize_a_brug.md).
* Christophe has passed the relay of the Brussels Chapter to Tiago
* Joren and Thomas have started a Ghent Chapter

## Ruby fosdem devroom

* Christophe organizes with Tyler the Ruby devroom at FOSDEM 2016
* Money left from last year should be trasnfered from Ruby Berlin to Ruby Belgium


## Registered Members (status, promotion)

* We have 26 members.
* How can we get more?

## Logo (potential designer, maybe already some suggestions)

* Via Joren, [Nathan de Witter](https://www.behance.net/nathandewitte) contacted me about making a logo.
* We'll have maybe some suggestions.

## Insurances

Christophe didn't have the time to get more info on that topic.

## Job Board (quick update)

* The job channel works well
* I heard multiple ppl that found a job through the community
* The repository doesn't work at all to share the a position.
* What should we do more?

## Shortage of junior Ruby devs (discussion)

On the job channel, a few ppl started a discussion about the shortage of junior ruby devs and what we can do

```
I think there's a shortage of capable professionals across the board (be it dev, frontend, designers)
​
11:04
meanwhile the market is overloaded with people who know "HTML/JS" or "PHP development" without experience
​
11:04
​
contemplating sigh​
toch
11:05 AM so we need to help them to come onboard
​
11:05
?
​
11:06
that could be a project for the association
stan
11:07 AM might be yeah
​
11:07
have trainee through the association ?
​
11:08
combined with a shared repo full of ressources « approved » by members
toch
11:09 AM and supported by companies
tiago
11:11 AM :+1:
nysthee
11:12 AM I also think there is a shortage of companies offering a decent apprenticeship .
defv
11:13 AM How would that work?
nysthee
11:15 AM http://www.apprentice.io/
toch
11:17 AM or maybe we should help the companies
​
11:17
i do not know, i can add the point to thenext asso meeting
​
11:17
that would be nice to have a discussion around that
​
11:18
would you come to discuss it?
defv
11:19 AM @nysthee: that's fine and dandy for companies like Thoughtbot, but hard for most belgian companies I personally came across
nysthee
11:24 AM Can you tell me what is hard about this concept? A lot of other industries are doing this all the time.
defv
11:27 AM At my current employer we're 2 rails developers and 1 frontender, at my previous it was kind of the same. At that scale it's really hard to take time away from day to day to mentor someone.
​
11:28
I can see it happen in a bigger consulting company, but there seem to be few of those (that I know) in .be
nysthee
11:32 AM I don’t think you should spend 8 hours a day sitting next to an apprentice. But maybe a combination of online courses and small project work could be an idea.
defv
11:32 AM adding to that, a 3 month paid internship is a lot of money :simple_smile:
​
11:33
granted, when you get a motivated, skilled team member from it it's great
​
11:33
and worth it
nysthee
11:33 AM Exactly.
​
11:34
Fact: there is no affordable rails course in Belgium, so I think the industry will have to do something.
defv
11:36 AM There's lewagon
nysthee
11:36 AM 5000 euro
​
11:37
Affordable :simple_smile:
toch
11:37 AM you can be supported by some subsudies
​
11:38
but i do not think a lot know it
​
11:38
still it s quite cheap compared with other bootcamp or profesional training
nysthee
11:38 AM Youngsters willing to learn a metier don’t have 5000 euro lying around.
toch
11:38 AM the question is do the companies want to do something about it?
​
11:39
+1 @nysthee i totally agree
​
11:40
because if the companies have chosen a technology ... if they want to keep it they need to do some effort Imho
maybe also it could be good to introduce ruby is some of classic training
and ofc the community could be a solution
​
11:41
(without mentioning that if a company does not do a proper onboarding ... it is building its own decrepitude) imho(edited)
​
11:43
but alone, it will be very hard
​
11:43
have you some ideas in mind?
nysthee
11:44 AM Offering a decent training by for example VDAB could be an idea (sponsored by the industry),
defv
11:47 AM The good times for Ruby developers was when some high schools (like HoWest) would give Ruby/Rails courses & projects
​
11:47
that's where @joren (for example) came from.
​
11:47
That also meant a steady stream of (unpaid) interns for Ruby projects
evert
11:49 AM why did they stop ?
defv
11:51 AM There was only 1 teacher that actively pursued that and he also started their mobile courses (iOS / Android) which soon meant there was no more time for Rails courses
​
11:53
We (Medialaan) have now asked our contacts at KDG hogeschool to give more general programming courses spanning a wider variety. So people wouldn't only see PHP and a mention of other languages, but to go more in depth about languages like Ruby, Python, Node.js, Go, ...
​
11:53
which would help us a lot
toch
11:54 AM i m sure we all have still some connections with university and high school, that would be interesting to do some lobying there
​
11:55
and maybe just start with a small presentation to talk about the modern lang
​
11:55
with ppl that can shre their experience
stan
12:03 PM the combination of online courses and factual projects in a company is a nice one I think. I had an intern who spent 6 months at the company. Granted he had strong understanding of OO concepts, but he was partially autonomous (I mean he could build a feature by himself, from start to code review) right after 2 months.
​
12:04
For my company, we had a paid intern who was productive for nearly 4 months
​
12:04
so it was a good « gamble »
​
12:04
and this is something we’ll do again this year of course
​
12:05
but it’s true, it takes some time from the company and the person in charge of the trainee
tiago
12:29 PM You should see it as a long-term investment. It's better to have a thriving ecosystem than to lose business money because you can't grow your IT team.
yuri
2:30 PM I  think even an intern should go thru a selection process and show that she/he can at least code a for(;;) cycle, and demonstrate that she/he is teachable. Some people are not...(edited)
stan
2:54 PM of course, they need to have basic understanding of algorithmic to work in a company
​
2:55
doesn’t mean they can’t learn
nysthee
2:57 PM indeed
```

What can we, the association, do to resolve that? (There are some suggestions in the discussion)

## Merge meetups (who does it, brug, rb, rg)

We discuss it, we agree, who can do it?

## monthly meeting

Christophe would like to have a montly board meeting. That will keep us more on the ball, but it will be also a good way to involve more ppl.
