## Introduction
### Welcome

We have created the association in march 2015, we did it for several reasons:

* providing a better structure to support the different events we were organizing
(BRUG, Ruby Burgers, Rails Girls, etc.)
* protecting the volunteers and members from any liability issues (as a de facto
organization we were all liable)
* building the means to support other projects/events
* being more visible and gathering more people

Basically, the organizers of the Ruby events gathered and founded the
association: Yannick (Ruby Burgers), Oana (Rails Girls), Joren and Hannes
(Arrrrcamp, and before ArrrrUG and BRUG), and I (BRUG). Except me and Joren, the
founders left the association and have been replaced by Boris, Lien, and Silvana.
Lien left later and have been replaced by Tiago.

The association counts xx full members and about xxx associate members. We
continue to organize our favorite activites, but we are missing people to help
to run the association itself. We're facing a difficult question: should we or
not disolve the association?

As reminder you can find the articles of
[the association on Github](https://github.com/brug-be/articles_of_association).

### Date & Place

I call the general assembly to gather in our discussion channel on xx Mar 2018.

### Presence, Quorum, Proxy, and Vote

The presence will be taken at the opening of the meeting.

In order to have valid election, we need a quorum of simple majority.

In order to disolve the association, we need a quorum of two third. It is
determined by a majority of four fifth of the vote.

If you can't attend the general assembly, you can give proxy to another full
member. A full member cannot proxy more than 3 other full members. Please inform
by email the board and the selected full member to whom you give proxy.

We'll use a service that allows to vote anonymously. Further instructions will
be sent before the general assembly.

### Agenda & Flow

In the following, you'll find the full agenda of the General Assembly. During
the meeting, we'll go through the whole, point by point, and address questions,
comments, and other remarks. In order to have an efficient meeting, the agenda
will be considered read by every present participants.

The president will lead and moderate the assembly.

The minutes will be taken by the secretary or another member.

I wish you good reading and see you all at the General Assembly.

## Activities Report 2016 and 2017

During the year 2016 and 2017, we had a lot of events:

* 10 Ruby Burgers in Brussels, in total it gathered about 150 persons
* 4 BRUG / Code Together (84 persons)
* 2 Rails Girls (60 persons)
* 2 Ruby Fosdem (17 speakers, audience varying from 50 to 80 attendants)
* Slack with now 278 members
* JobBoard with +10 job openings

### Ruby Burgers

Still a succesfull event, always full (between 15 and 20).

### BRUG / Code Together

- Switched to Co.Station from 11/2016 to 02/2017, sponsored by Le Wagon. Pros: central place, amphitheater for talks. Cons: rooms not always available, CS staff not always cooperative.
- Switched to Kamoon for the catering, sponsored by DataCamp. Pros: good healthy meals. Cons: individual servings are a PITA to manage, due to the dynamic nature of the attendees list.
- Tried the semi-free catering option: free for full members, €5 otherwise. The purpose was to have an incentive to get more members, which worked reasonably well. I didn't hear any negative comment about the system or the fees. Managing the €5 payments (mostly in cash) is a PITA, though.
- Attendance: 11/2016: 21 (YouTube talk), 12/2016: 6 (no talk), 01/2017: 37 (Stan's workshop), 02/2017: 20 (Stan's workshop).
- Asked for help to co-organize the next ones, due to my own burnout. Heard crickets. So the event went on an (ongoing) hiatus.
- Created branded materials.

### Rails Girls

- led by Silavna
- organised 2 editions as part of Ruby BE (2016&2017) in close collaboration with LeWagon
- both as part of the European Code Week 
- 2017 updates: 
       - organised together with a team (Tiago, Anne, Stan and Sandjiv)
       - partnered up with BeCode and BeCentral
- always an awesome experience for all
- Great team, great results, especially considering the relatively short timeframe.
- The organization could have been smoother and less stressful with more volunteers. 
- BeCentral was a fit location for the event. Only annoying point: the building door needs a badge, or someone to rush downstairs, to be opened.
- Tiago's main task was to find coaches. Their number ended up just right: 11 for Friday, 13 for Saturday, which allowed for groups of 2 to 3 students. Things to improve: book more women coaches (there were none this time).
- Tiago experimented with a short live-cast between 4 Rails Girls cities. Fun experience. Will need better rehearsal for next time. Audio was challenging, and would probably work better with only 2 cities at the same time.
- Lightning talks were well done and well received. Some could have been slightly shorter, to keep the energy going.
- The official installation guide is outdated. Friday time could be saved by updating it.
- Follow-ups for students didn't really work this time either. Should / could probably be planned before the event, with more wo-manpower.

### Ruby Fosdem

Two editions with good lineup:

* [2016](https://archive.fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/ruby/)
* [2017](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/ruby/)

### Slack

- More members
- Decreasing activity

### JobBoard

- the need is there
- painful to manage
- too cheap

### Miscellaneous

- Boris

  - Completely rebranded the org (logo, website, personna’s)
  - Designed Stickers
  - Attempted to structure the org workflow
  - Created job survey which people are still refering to

- Tiago
  - Became acting board member after Lien decided to vacate her seat. 
  - Took over the meetup.com account ownership in September 2017. The 6 months subscription has been paid by Ruby Belgium via Joren (€25.50).

### Dissolution

Should we or not? to provide a longer explanation.

### Project 2018 and new board

We (Martin, Sandjiv, Tiago, Silvana, Laszlo, Ana & Stan) are candidates to the next board. First of all, we want to thank the current board for their dedication those last years. While our backgrounds and skills differ, we have benefited from RubyBelgium community and want to contribute to see it continue.

The 7 of us are ready to invest our time and energy to grow and nurture the community.

#### First objectives

One of the first actions we would like to do is to contact the community to ask what people expect from RubyBelgium, in order to serve it the best we can. Altough we care about every Rubyist, regardless of experience, gender or origin, we think the community should be specially warm to the people new in the field - they are the future of the community, and experienced Rubyist often have already their own networks. We see an important role for us as mentors for the newer/younger members.

Our first objective would be to reactivate the monthly "Code Together" - events where we can meet and talk about our various projects, with the occasional talk or live code. Those events are also a good way to get in contact with the community. We are also keen to continue organizing Rails Girls.

#### Budget 2018

Regarding budget, while important we feel that most of our ambitions require first and foremost time. Having some money could help get for example food and drinks in the events. Until further discussion can be hold, we propose to maintain the current 25€ stipend for members to be able to vote. Should more monetary means be necessary, we would like to reach to the companies benefiting from the eco system - starting with those we are working with/for, either for direct money transfer or to sponsor costly activities. We may want to look at subsidy opportunities also.

#### Association

As for the association, the following people would like to apply for these given roles:

* Martin, for the role of Secretary
* Laszlo, for the role of Treasurer
* Stan, for the role of President

#### Personal Investment

To do so, each of us is going to make space in their own lives, but we also intend to reach to a "second circle" of people that may be interested to help on a irregular basis.

#### New Team

To conclude our proposal, here are a few words regarding the motivation of each and everyone of us:

##### Ana
Working at Le Wagon, I noticed my students were eager to join the world of coding, but didn't know where to start. They are my main motivation for joining Ruby Belgium, as I hope we can organise events that will bring juniors and more experience developers to meet in a fantastic atmosphere! As a feminist, I am also committed to question why most of my students are men, and I hope Ruby Belgium, through inclusive workshops such as Rails Girls, has the potential to be a big step for better representation

##### Laszlo

Code, Education, Mentoring and working to grow a cool community. A bit of all my favourite topics are on the table with this organization, . Working a lot with juniors as a coach at Le Wagon, Techies Lab, in my own agency or even once at Rails Girls, one of my biggest conclusion is that juniors are capable but they need a boost in their self-confidence in order to perform and grow as developers. Mentoring and different kind of events that Ruby Belgium has always perform and others that it could perform could give them that boost. On another hand, I believe that computer science should have a bigger spot in the general culture in order to make it in the general education system. And as Ruby is beginner-friendly, I'm sure Ruby Belgium could be a good initiator to start that process.

##### Martin

I like coding - but I also like teaching/coaching, activities I've kept as "side jobs" since a while now. Meeting and helping members of the community would be a way for me to "pay back" what others have done for me as a young developer, and hopefully help them as much joy in Ruby and programming

##### Sandjiv

I've arrived in Brussel not so long ago, and out of work, Ruby Belgium member are about the only people i know so i 'd like to help as much as possible to bring said people together and maybe give to newcomers the same experience. I like putting processes in place and looking at them while they continue and evolve so I figured Ruby Belgium would be a good place to be.

##### Silvana

Main motivation is to organize fun meet-ups for people who learn Ruby, focusing on beginners. Secondary motivation is to share beers and knowledge with friends of Ruby.

##### Stan

I've arrived in Belgium 4 years ago and Ruby Belgium (which at the time was only based on the Meetups I think) really helped both professionnaly and personnaly. It gave me a boost of confidence and I saw first-hand the impact we can have on juniors. After helping around sporadically, I'd like to be more invested and lead changes, bring the community tighter together, help organize events and put an emphasis on newcomers to nurture a lasting community!

#### Tiago

A community (and an association) like Ruby Belgium only makes sense if it's for and by enthusiast people. I've felt this renewed enthusiasm in all the new board member candidates. With them, I believe we can organize delightful events again, that will help others, especially beginners and newcomers, to learn, enjoy, and share the good spirit around Ruby we all cherish.

### Election of the board 2018

New members to vote for:

* Martin
* Laszlo
* Stan

Vote for the 3 new board members.

### Dissolution of the board 2016-2017

The current board will be dissolved at the end of May 2018.

## Approval of Membership Fee 2018

The Board suggests to keep it the same than last year, i.e. 25€, as we do not
have yet a clear definition of what we can offer back.

## Approval Budget 2018

Cf the budget above.

## Closing

The General Assembly will be closed with some final words.
