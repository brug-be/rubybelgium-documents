## Introduction
### Welcome

We have created the association in march 2015, we did it for several reasons:

* providing a better structure to support the different events we were organizing
(BRUG, Ruby Burgers, Rails Girls, etc.)
* protecting the volunteers and members from any liability issues (as a de facto
organization we were all liable)
* building the means to support other projects/events
* being more visible and gathering more people

Basically, the organizers of the Ruby events gathered and founded the
association: Yannick (Ruby Burgers), Oana (Rails Girls), Joren and Hannes
(Arrrrcamp, and before ArrrrUG and BRUG), and I (BRUG). Except me and Joren, the
founders left the association and have been replaced by Boris, Lien, and Silvana.
Lien left later and have been replaced by Tiago.

The association counts xx full members and about xxx associate members. We
continue to organize our favorite activites, but we are missing people to help
to run the association itself. We're facing a difficult question: should we or
not disolve the association?

As reminder you can find the articles of
[the association on Github](https://github.com/brug-be/articles_of_association).

### Date & Place

I call the general assembly to gather in our discussion channel on xx Mar 2018.

### Presence, Quorum, Proxy, and Vote

The presence will be taken at the opening of the meeting.

In order to have valid election, we need a quorum of simple majority.

In order to disolve the association, we need a quorum of two third. It is
determined by a majority of four fifth of the vote.

If you can't attend the general assembly, you can give proxy to another full
member. A full member cannot proxy more than 3 other full members. Please inform
by email the board and the selected full member to whom you give proxy.

We'll use a service that allows to vote anonymously. Further instructions will
be sent before the general assembly.

### Agenda & Flow

In the following, you'll find the full agenda of the General Assembly. During
the meeting, we'll go through the whole, point by point, and address questions,
comments, and other remarks. In order to have an efficient meeting, the agenda
will be considered read by every present participants.

The president will lead and moderate the assembly.

The minutes will be taken by the secretary or another member.

I wish you good reading and see you all at the General Assembly.

## Activities Report 2016 and 2017

During the year 2016 and 2017, we had a lot of events:

* 10 Ruby Burgers in Brussels, in total it gathered about 150 persons
* 4 BRUG / Code Together (84 persons)
* 2 Rails Girls (60 persons)
* 2 Ruby Fosdem (17 speakers, audience varying from 50 to 80 attendants)
* Slack with now 278 members
* JobBoard with +10 job openings

### Ruby Burgers

Still a succesfull event, always full (between 15 and 20).

### BRUG / Code Together

- Switched to Co.Station from 11/2016 to 02/2017, sponsored by Le Wagon. Pros: central place, amphitheater for talks. Cons: rooms not always available, CS staff not always cooperative.
- Switched to Kamoon for the catering, sponsored by DataCamp. Pros: good healthy meals. Cons: individual servings are a PITA to manage, due to the dynamic nature of the attendees list.
- Tried the semi-free catering option: free for full members, €5 otherwise. The purpose was to have an incentive to get more members, which worked reasonably well. I didn't hear any negative comment about the system or the fees. Managing the €5 payments (mostly in cash) is a PITA, though.
- Attendance: 11/2016: 21 (YouTube talk), 12/2016: 6 (no talk), 01/2017: 37 (Stan's workshop), 02/2017: 20 (Stan's workshop).
- Asked for help to co-organize the next ones, due to my own burnout. Heard crickets. So the event went on an (ongoing) hiatus.
- Created branded materials.

### Rails Girls

- led by Silavna
- organised 2 editions as part of Ruby BE (2016&2017) in close collaboration with LeWagon
- both as part of the European Code Week 
- 2017 updates: 
       - organised together with a team (Tiago, Anne, Stan and Sandjiv)
       - partnered up with BeCode and BeCentral
- always an awesome experience for all
- Great team, great results, especially considering the relatively short timeframe.
- The organization could have been smoother and less stressful with more volunteers. 
- BeCentral was a fit location for the event. Only annoying point: the building door needs a badge, or someone to rush downstairs, to be opened.
- Tiago's main task was to find coaches. Their number ended up just right: 11 for Friday, 13 for Saturday, which allowed for groups of 2 to 3 students. Things to improve: book more women coaches (there were none this time).
- Tiago experimented with a short live-cast between 4 Rails Girls cities. Fun experience. Will need better rehearsal for next time. Audio was challenging, and would probably work better with only 2 cities at the same time.
- Lightning talks were well done and well received. Some could have been slightly shorter, to keep the energy going.
- The official installation guide is outdated. Friday time could be saved by updating it.
- Follow-ups for students didn't really work this time either. Should / could probably be planned before the event, with more wo-manpower.

### Ruby Fosdem

Two editions with good lineup:

* [2016](https://archive.fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/ruby/)
* [2017](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/ruby/)

### Slack

- More members
- Decreasing activity

### JobBoard

- the need is there
- painful to manage
- too cheap

### Miscellaneous

- Boris

  - Completely rebranded the org (logo, website, personna’s)
  - Designed Stickers
  - Attempted to structure the org workflow
  - Created job survey which people are still refering to

- Tiago
  - Became acting board member after Lien decided to vacate her seat. 
  - Took over the meetup.com account ownership in September 2017. The 6 months subscription has been paid by Ruby Belgium via Joren (€25.50).
