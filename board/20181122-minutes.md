## Topics

### Recap last board

Recap RG

- Nice but a lot of last minute drop.
- Improvement to be done on communication (who's in or not)
- Silvana to hand over (progressively)
- Good feedback, but could be better
- Be part of something bigger (Women in code week here) is nice
- Ana & Clementine to step in

Laszlo's proposal (short as Laszlo could not make it)

- Ambitious
- In line with objectives (events first but look for more)
- Finance related, board is more at ease with sponsorship than with selling services (we have no goals to be a web agency)

### Subsidy for admin work

- Aim for an half time?
- Admin/comm/marketing
- Agreement that this would help a lot for the long term
- Martin to check options (where should we apply to), contact Laszlo in case he looked already

### Next Events

- Code Together:
  - XMas edition (Martin)
  - January (Stan)
- RG: Mid January (Ana)
  - 12 january
  - Trello
- Ruby Burger (Boris)

### Accesses to remaining documents

- Check Boris
- Google Drive
- Mailing list
- Check 1pass or equivalent for non profit? (managing accesses is a mess)

### Objective Q1/2019

- Keep the lights on - events: RG (4x) and Code Together (10x)
- Get an administrative help to start growing our goals

### Next Board

Week of the 14/1
