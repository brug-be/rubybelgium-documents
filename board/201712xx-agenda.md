## Introduction
### Welcome

We have created the association in march 2015, we did it for several reasons:

* providing a better structure to support the different events we were organizing
(BRUG, Ruby Burgers, Rails Girls, etc.)
* protecting the volunteers and members from any liability issues (as a de facto
organization we were all liable)
* building the means to support other projects/events
* being more visible and gathering more people

Basically, the organizers of the Ruby events gathered and founded the
association: Yannick (Ruby Burgers), Oana (Rails Girls), Joren and Hannes
(Arrrrcamp, and before ArrrrUG and BRUG), and I (BRUG). Except me and Joren, the
founders left the association and have been replaced by Boris, Lien, and Silvana.
Lien left later and have been replaced by Tiago.

The association counts xx full members and about xxx associate members. We
continue to organize our favorite activites, but we are missing people to help
to run the association itself. We're facing a difficult question: should we or
not disolve the association?

As reminder you can find the articles of
[the association on Github](https://github.com/brug-be/articles_of_association).

### Date & Place

I call the general assembly to gather in our discussion channel on xx xxx 2017.

### Presence, Quorum, Proxy, and Vote

The presence will be taken at the opening of the meeting.

In order to have valid election, we need a quorum of simple majority.

In order to disolve the association, we need a quorum of two third. It is
determined by a majority of four fifth of the vote.

If you can't attend the general assembly, you can give proxy to another full
member. A full member cannot proxy more than 3 other full members. Please inform
by email the board and the selected full member to whom you give proxy.

We'll use a service that allows to vote anonymously. Further instructions will
be sent before the general assembly.

### Agenda & Flow

In the following, you'll find the full agenda of the General Assembly. During
the meeting, we'll go through the whole, point by point, and address questions,
comments, and other remarks. In order to have an efficient meeting, the agenda
will be considered read by every present participants.

I wish you good reading and see you all at the General Assembly.
