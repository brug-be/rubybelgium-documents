## Boris

- je constate que l'activité trello est morte. Comment l'interpréter?
Personne ne fait qq ch ou personne n'utilise l'outil pour organiser son
travail?  :stuck_out_tongue:
- no progress on the beginner meetup except I might do an experiment
with Anne that could serve as a proof of concepts for us after. To be
confirmed
- Slack is a bit dead these days, what to do? Recruit someone to do
community management?
- take down *rubyjobs*.be if possible and replace with google form like
on http://uxdesignin.be/jobs

done:
-
https://github.com/brug-be/rubybelgium/issues?q=is%3Aissue+assignee%3Aborisrorsvort+is%3Aclosed
- involving people in the community by managing small project with them
for the site

## Silvana

Here's what I've been working on for the next RG:

*    partnered-up with LeWagon&CoStation to organise the next RG on 21-22 October: CoStation provides location for free and LeWagon will sponsor us financially
*    brought Tiphaine on board. Had a planning meeting: timeline for RG and general discussion on future events: Beginners
     Meetup and Study Groups - if ready, to be announced and put in place during RG in Oct
*    Tiphaine designing future merchandise for RG
*    informed BetaCowork about choosing to do the second RG this year at CoStation
*    discussed how to better match coaches and participants
*    looking into something like small gifts for coaches ... like beer or coffee :)

* fail to org rubycamp
* manage the jobboard
* answering ppl

* schedule next board quickly
* write down some process (such as General Assembly, publishing new board composition)
* job board

## Joren

What I did:

* worked my way through the financial document, but the French stuff is sometimes hard for me to understand, but I’m working on it
* had a hard time with keytrade with the extra stuff for Boris: tl;dr: they gave us the wrong form :disappointed: so we have to start over again
* started working on a workflow for doing the finances

next:

* redo the form for Boris to get him access to the account
* finish the workflow and pass it to you to review if I’m not missing anything
* short term: make sure Tiago get’s his money back for the BRUG stuffI also can contact 10to1 for rubyjobs.be and I have to put up something on the ArrrrCamp website
